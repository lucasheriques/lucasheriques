# Hi! I'm Lucas Faria, nice to meet you. üëã

**I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating magical interactions in software.** I consider myself a [product-minded engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/): focused on creating business value and understanding what makes a product shine.

I love <Link href="bytes/social-side-of-software-engineering" target="_self">talking to customers</Link>, understanding their pains and helping them achieve their goals. I'm a strong believer in the power of curiosity and the importance of asking questions.

I have worked with companies of all sizes:

- Large corporations: [Brex](https://www.brex.com/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)
- Early-stage startups: [Increment](https://www.joinincrement.com/), [Booqsi](https://www.booqsi.com/)
- Software consulting: [ioasys](https://ioasys.com.br/en)

I have been living together with my fianc√©e, Iara, since 2020, and our three little pets, Ayla, Luan, and Luna. I love coding, [cooking](https://receitas.lucasfaria.dev/), reading, nature, and animals! üåµüêæüìöüç≥
