# Hi! I'm Lucas Faria, nice to meet you. 👋

**I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating magical interactions in software.** I consider myself a [product-minded engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/): focused on creating business value and understanding what makes a product shine.

I love <Link href="bytes/social-side-of-software-engineering" target="_self">talking to customers</Link>, understanding their pains and helping them achieve their goals. I'm a strong believer in the power of curiosity and the importance of asking questions.

Check my [resume](https://cv.lucasfaria.dev/).

I have two publications:

- [lucasfaria.dev](https://lucasfaria.dev/writing): technical articles about what I learn and share bits of knowledge publicly.
- [Dev na Gringa](https://newsletter.nagringa.dev/): Portuguese newsletter with practical advice for career growth, soft skills and working remotely.

I have been living together with my fiancée, Iara, since 2020, and our three little pets, Ayla, Luan, and Luna. I love coding, [cooking](https://receitas.lucasfaria.dev/), reading, nature, and animals! 🌵🐾📚🍳
